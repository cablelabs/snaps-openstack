# SNAPS-OpenStack

SNAPS-OpenStack is *step two* for the SNAPS<sup>TM</sup> Program we are
developing at [CableLabs](http://cablelabs.com/). It is an
[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) Kolla installer for machines that have
been initialized with [SNAPS-Boot](https://github.com/cablelabs/snaps-boot).

If you're working with Software Defined Networks (SDN), Network Function
Virtualization (NFV) or just building your own cloud, then this is where you
want to be.

> TIP: [SNAPS-OO](https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/SNAP/SNAPS-OO+Home) is where
you should go next. SNAPS-OO is an [OPNFV](https://www.opnfv.org/) project.
You'll also want to check out the [gerrit
repo](https://gerrit.opnfv.org/gerrit/#/admin/projects/snaps) and the
[documentation](http://artifacts.opnfv.org/snaps/docs/how-to-use/index.html).

## Getting started

[SNAPS-Boot](https://github.com/cablelabs/snaps-boot) is a prerequisite for
SNAPS-OpenStack, so you'll want to start there.

Once you've completed the [SNAPS-Boot](https://github.com/cablelabs/snaps-boot)
install, you'll want to read the [SNAPS-OpenStack install
guide](doc/source/install/install.md). The fun really begins with the
[installation
steps](https://github.com/cablelabs/snaps-openstack/blob/master/doc/source/install/install.md#4-installation-step).
That's where you'll be able to clone this repo and commence building:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cablelabs/snaps-openstack.git
```

If you're new to git and GitHub, be sure to check out the [Pro
Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. [GitHub
Help](https://help.github.com/) is also outstanding.

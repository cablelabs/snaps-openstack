# SNAPS-OpenStack

SNAPS-OpenStack is *step two* for the SDN/NFV Application Platform and Stack
(SNAPS<sup>TM</sup>) we are developing at [CableLabs](http://cablelabs.com/).
It is an [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) Kolla installer for machines
that have been initialized with
[SNAPS-Boot](https://github.com/cablelabs/snaps-boot).

If you're working with Software Defined Networks (SDN), Network Function
Virtualization (NFV) or just building your own cloud, then this is where you
want to be.

## Getting started

To get started, you'll want to read the [SNAPS-OpenStack install
guide](doc/source/install/install.md). The fun really begins with the
[installation
steps](https://github.com/cablelabs/snaps-openstack/blob/master/doc/source/install/install.md#4-installation-step).
That's where you'll be able to clone this repo and commence building:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cablelabs/snaps-openstack.git
```

If you're new to git and GitHub, be sure to check out the [Pro
Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. [GitHub
Help](https://help.github.com/) is also outstanding.

## Contributing

SNAPS-OpenStack was originally built by [CableLabs](http://cablelabs.com/) and
[Aricent](https://www.aricent.com/), but we could use your help! Check out our
[contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.
